##Landscan
###website: http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/
####description: Using an innovative approach with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, ORNL's LandScanâ„¢ is the community standard for global population distribution. At approximately 1 km resolution (30" X 30"), LandScan is the finest resolution global population distribution data available and represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm, an R&D 100 Award Winner, uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region.

#####High Resolution Urban Feature Extraction for Global Population Mapping using High Performance Computing

Paper discusses an automated parallel algorithm that has been implemented on a high performance computing environment to extract urban regions from high resolution images using texture and spectral features.

LandScan is a dasymetric
geospatial model that decomposes the best available census
data to finer resolutions using geographic, physiographic,
socioeconomic, and cultural indicator data and high-resolution
imagery. The LandScan model uses estimates of urban land
cover as an important factor in decomposing the best available
census data into high-resolution raster cells. For many areas of
the world, existing land cover data does not capture new urban
developments and urban sprawl. The traditional approach for
updating land cover data for the LandScan model has included
manual interpretation of high resolution (1-5 meter) imagery to
augment urban area delineations that are based on medium (30
meter) to coarse (1 km) resolution satellite imagery. The
amount of high resolution imagery that needs to be analyzed is
increasing in the order of terabytes. Manual interpretation of
such a huge volume of imagery data is tedious and expensive.
Various algorithms for automated extraction of urban regions
from remotely sensed imagery have been presented in the
literature but most of these algorithms are compute intensive. 


##WorldPop
###website: http://www.worldpop.org.uk/
####description: The WorldPop project was initiated in October 2013 to combine the AfriPop, AsiaPop and AmeriPop population mapping projects. It aims to provide an open access archive of spatial demographic datasets for Central and South America, Africa and Asia to support development and health applications. The methods used are designed with full open access and operational application in mind, using transparent, fully documented and shareable methods to produce easily updatable maps with accompanying metadata.

####data resolution and coverage: South America, Africa, Asia (http://www.worldpop.org.uk/data/) 

####data availability: Open data
