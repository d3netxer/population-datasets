##Landscan
###website: http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/
####description: Using an innovative approach with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, ORNL's LandScanâ„¢ is the community standard for global population distribution. At approximately 1 km resolution (30" X 30"), LandScan is the finest resolution global population distribution data available and represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm, an R&D 100 Award Winner, uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region.

####data resolution and coverage: approximately 1 km resolution (30" X 30"),

##WorldPop
###website: http://www.worldpop.org.uk/
####description: The WorldPop project was initiated in October 2013 to combine the AfriPop, AsiaPop and AmeriPop population mapping projects. It aims to provide an open access archive of spatial demographic datasets for Central and South America, Africa and Asia to support development and health applications. The methods used are designed with full open access and operational application in mind, using transparent, fully documented and shareable methods to produce easily updatable maps with accompanying metadata.

####data resolution and coverage: South America, Africa, Asia (http://www.worldpop.org.uk/data/) 

####data availability: Open data
