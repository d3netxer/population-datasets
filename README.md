##Landscan
###website: http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/
####description: Using an innovative approach with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, ORNL's LandScan™ is the community standard for global population distribution. At approximately 1 km resolution (30" X 30"), LandScan is the finest resolution global population distribution data available and represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm, an R&D 100 Award Winner, uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region.

Best available census countrs were distributed to cells based on probability coefficients which, in turn, were based on road provimity, slope land cover, and nighttime lights.

Paper discusses an automated parallel algorithm that has been implemented on a high performance computing environment to extract urban regions from high resolution images using texture and spectral features.

LandScan is a dasymetric
geospatial model that decomposes the best available census
data to finer resolutions using geographic, physiographic,
socioeconomic, and cultural indicator data and high-resolution
imagery. The LandScan model uses estimates of urban land
cover as an important factor in decomposing the best available
census data into high-resolution raster cells. For many areas of
the world, existing land cover data does not capture new urban
developments and urban sprawl. The traditional approach for
updating land cover data for the LandScan model has included
manual interpretation of high resolution (1-5 meter) imagery to
augment urban area delineations that are based on medium (30
meter) to coarse (1 km) resolution satellite imagery. The
amount of high resolution imagery that needs to be analyzed is
increasing in the order of terabytes. Manual interpretation of
such a huge volume of imagery data is tedious and expensive.
Various algorithms for automated extraction of urban regions
from remotely sensed imagery have been presented in the
literature but most of these algorithms are compute intensive. 


##WorldPop
###website: http://www.worldpop.org.uk/
####description: The WorldPop project was initiated in October 2013 to combine the AfriPop, AsiaPop and AmeriPop population mapping projects. It aims to provide an open access archive of spatial demographic datasets for Central and South America, Africa and Asia to support development and health applications. The methods used are designed with full open access and operational application in mind, using transparent, fully documented and shareable methods to produce easily updatable maps with accompanying metadata.

####data resolution and coverage: South America, Africa, Asia (http://www.worldpop.org.uk/data/)

##Using Night-time lights to estimate population

Comparing the spatial distribution of light emissions to that of human population reveals the
short comings of using night-time lights as an absolute proxy for the location of human
settlements. Large parts of the developing world remain without access to electricity despite
sizable populations. Nonetheless studies have shown the utility of night-time lights to be a
descriptor of urban location and urban population (Sutton et al., 2001). More recently, studies
have focused on whether night-time light imagery can be used to assess levels of access to
electricity (Doll and Pachauri, 2010; Elvidge et al., 2010). An obstacle in undertaking such
studies is that an appreciation or estimate of the level of population which goes undetected is
helpful to interpret the results. Given the very wide range of levels of development and use of
lighting across the world, this study seeks understand what level of population can be detected in
different regions of the world.
